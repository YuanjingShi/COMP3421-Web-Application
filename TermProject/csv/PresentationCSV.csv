1570015510,keynote,From DUMB computers to SMART computing,Patt,Yale N.,10,patt.jpg,Yale,9:00,10:00,3/11/14,"Yale Patt is the Ernest Cockrell, Jr. Centennial Chair in Engineering and Distinguished University Teaching Professor at The University of Texas at Austin. He directs the research of eight PhD students, while enjoying an active consulting practice with several microprocessor manufacturers. ","As the keynote in this first IEEE Conference on Smart Computing, it is useful to ask what smart computing is, and how we can ever get there when we must start with dumb computers, since computers really are electronic idiots that do exactly what they are told to do one very simple step at a time, and do so with very simple structures. The organizers of this conference have correctly recognized that designing and building a smart computing system requires two things: determining what the smart computing system one wants to build is, and harnessing computing technology to build it. In this talk I will try to examine what these two requirements involve, what each of us needs to bring to the table to be effective contributers, and what needs to happen to get us ready to produce smart computing systems.",
