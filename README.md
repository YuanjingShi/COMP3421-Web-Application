# Exercise-From-leetcode-and-Cracking-the-Interview

This is a repository of my own solutions of leetcode & cc150 problems.

Java would be my first choice for programming language and later I may upload some corresponding solutions in Python.

Update: There would be also some algorithm problem from 九章算法
